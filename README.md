# WT-Project-2021

StuWorld is a web application built to help students in their day-to-day life although the targeted audience is Students this application would be helpful for working professionals also.

Services offered by the Web App are as follows.

* Task Tracker Application: This application is just like a To-Do list here, we have provided 4 different lists as Backlog, Progress, Completed, and on-hold. These lists can be populated with different tasks that a student needs to do and as per the type of task it can be placed in any one of the lists and then can be dragged and dropped to other lists. For example, suppose I had to complete an assignment so initially I would put it in the backlog list then when I have started doing it I can drag it to the progress list and after completing it I can move it to the completed list.

* Calculator: This is a simple calculator app that can be used to do immediate calculations. The student doesnâ€™t have to look for their calculator or mobile app and it can also save them from getting distracted by something else like, for example, any messages on the mobile phone can distract student while he/she tries to open the calculator.

* Paint: This can be used for fun by the students to refresh their minds from the heavy workload. It can also be used as a Whiteboard to visualize thoughts, concepts, write down ideas, etc.

* Countdown Timer: Many times students need some kind of timer that could help them out to focus on their learning by keeping track of the time left in their hands and this application serves that purpose. For an example of where it could be used, suppose I have my Semester final exams so I can keep track of how many days, hours I am left with to prepare for the exams.
